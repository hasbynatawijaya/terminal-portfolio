# Terminal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with a terminal-like interface. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides contact information.

**Visit the site here: [https://hasbynatawijaya.github.io/terminal-portfolio/](https://hasbynatawijaya.github.io/terminal-portfolio/)**

## Technologies Used

* **TypeScript:** For a more robust and maintainable codebase.
* **SCSS:** For styling with variables and a scalable architecture.
* **Webpack:** A module bundler to optimize and manage project assets.
* **HTML5:** The structural foundation of the website.
* **GitHub Pages:** For deployment and hosting.

## Features

* **Interactive Terminal Interface:** Navigate the portfolio using familiar command-line commands.
* **Dynamic Content:** Portfolio data (about me, projects, skills, contact) is loaded from separate JSON files, making updates easier.
* **Clear Navigation:** Simple commands like `help`, `about`, `projects`, `skills`, `contact`, and `clear` allow users to explore the site.
* **Project Showcase:** Detailed information about my featured projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
* **Skills Overview:** A categorized list of my technical skills.
* **Contact Information:** Easy ways to get in touch.
* **Automatic Scrolling:** The terminal output automatically scrolls to the bottom on new commands.
* **Responsive Design:** (While not explicitly in the code, the terminal layout is generally adaptable to different screen sizes).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will build the project and open it in your default web browser using `webpack-dev-server`.
